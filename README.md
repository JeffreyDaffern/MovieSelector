# MovieSelector

Takes a list of movies and randomly selects and prints to screen various information about the movie. The selection process is modified by user-selected criteria. It is my intention to eventually have this program query TheMovieDatabas's database to display the movie posters and information, and I have acquired an API key for this purpose, but for now the images are hard coded until I get that working. The program has 2 GUI windows. The first is a loading screen and once a file is loaded, it brings up the main GUI. The user can then randomly select a movie from the entire list, or they can choose a specific genre, rating, critic rating, or whether they want to include movies they have seen from this list. Once a movie is displayed, the user can mark "Watched" if they intend to watch the movie, which will modify their list for future uses of this program.
