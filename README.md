# MovieSelector

Takes a list of movies and randomly selects and prints to screen various information about the movie. The selection process is modified by user-selected criteria. It is my intention to eventually have this program query TheMovieDatabas's database to display the movie posters and information, and I have acquired an API key for this purpose, but for now the images are hard coded until I get that working. The program has 2 GUI windows. The first is a loading screen and once a file is loaded, it brings up the main GUI.
